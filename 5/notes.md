## Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

### Loops
Discussed loops. These are present in the .py files.

## Range
Range is a function that returns a sequence of numbers.
The syntax is as follows:
    range(start, stop, step)

### Summary
In the .py files are some examples of range and random functions, aswell as for loops.
Again, today was a little simple and nothing I haven't covered previously.
