## Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings

### Data Types
Strings store successions of characters - "Hello"
Integers store numbers.
Floats is a larger data type for store numbers to a decimal point.
Boolean is true or false.

### Mathematical Operators
3 + 5
7 - 4
3 * 2
4 / 2
2 ** 2 (2 to the power of 2)
\// - Floor division

PEMDAS
\() - Parenthesis
\** - Exponents
\* - Division
\/ - Multiplication
\+ - Addition 
\- - Subtraction

Multiplication and Division, and Addtion and Subtraction, are of the same priority, and which ever is called first executes first.

# Formatted strings
print(f"{this} is a {formatted} string")

### Summary
Day Two was very simple and went over the basics of data types, mathematical operators and formatted stings.
