## Control Flow and Logical Operators

### If statements
An if statement is made up of a condition and a result. 
If it's raining outside, take an umbrella. 

There is also else statements which would be a condition, a result and an alternative. 
If it's raining outside, take an umbrella. Else, take sunglasses.

See odd-or-even.py for an example.

You can add more conditions to an if statement by using elif.

See rollecoaster.py for an example.

# Summary
Day three was quite simple. If statements, conditionals etc. Nothing I haven't done before.
I'm going to keep the notes brief for the first couple of weeks, until the more advanced topics start to crop up.
