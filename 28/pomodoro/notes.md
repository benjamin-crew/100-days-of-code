### Day 28 - Tkinter, Dynamic Typing and the Pomodoro GUI Application

## Dynamic Typing
Dynamic Typing is the ability to change the data type of a variable depending on what is present in that variable.
For instance, this is an int:

    var = 5

But if I then update the variable to:

    var = "Ben"

It now becomes a string.
