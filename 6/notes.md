### Python Functions & Karel

## Functions
Functions are excerpts of code that can be called upon. They're used to package a block of code that will be called upon multiple times.

Lots of notes on functions here:

## Styling

## While Loops
Loop while a condition is met, or whilst a condition isn't met, i.e. loop until a = 5.

    while something_is_true:
        # Do this

Be careful not to fall into an infinite loop!

### Summary
I got some loop practice using https://reeborg.ca/, but again, today wasn't very difficult as it's still quite basic.
My loop notes are in my Notion, so no point doubling up: https://www.notion.so/2ade684e759c44aebfe0344fc402c161?v=967010a9f1ac4418ad7c9bbb1eb6734e
